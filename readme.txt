This shell was written by myself and three other students whoose names are in the group.txt file.

It has several commands implimented as well as serialization. It was written for a class project using scrum development cycle and planned using CRC cards. All of which have been included in this upload. Also included, is the test file used to test the various shell function.

note: Please use Netbeans for testing - javac on commandline causes compile error.
